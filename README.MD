# Responsive Web Design
Responsive web design is an approach to designing and developing websites that ensures they work well on a variety of devices and screen sizes. The goal is to provide an optimal viewing experience, whether users are on a desktop, laptop, tablet, or smartphone.

Here are some key principles of responsive web design:

### Fluid Grids
Instead of using fixed-width layouts, responsive design uses fluid grids that adjust to the size of the screen. This means that the content and layout can scale proportionally based on the screen size.

### Flexible Images
Images and other media elements are also scaled to fit the screen size. This ensures that images don't overflow their containers or appear too small on larger screens.

### Media Queries
These are CSS techniques used to apply different styles based on the device's characteristics, such as screen width, height, or orientation. Media queries help tailor the layout and appearance of the site to different devices.

### Responsive Typography
Text sizes and line lengths are adjusted to be legible and aesthetically pleasing across different devices.

# Black Birds

The example you're going to work with is a website that lists various black birds and provides a description of each, to help people learn more about them and their differences.

# What to do
After cloning this repository and opening it in VSCode, you'll notice two folders. One with some basic code to start with, and another with a completed solution.

Open up the complete version in the browser. Then open the developer tools (to the console view, so you don't see the CSS), enable the device toolbar with responsive dimensions selected. Now you can resize the view area to different sizes to see how this website should look at different sizes.

Next, open the starting version in the browser. You'll need to make changes to the CSS to make this version look and function like the completed one. This will probably be quite difficult. Use the hints below to help walk you through the process.



# Hints:
This layout uses a row-direction flexbox inside of a column-direction flexbox.

These are all the style rules added in the completed CSS: display, flex, flex-direction, flex-wrap, order. Look them up if you're not sure how to use each of them.

If you feel stumped, definitely look at the example CSS. It's fine to use that as a reference, but you should manually type in all the changes, to better reinforce your learning.
